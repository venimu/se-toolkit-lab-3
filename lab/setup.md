# Lab setup

## Find a partner

1. Find a classmate to be your partner for this lab.
2. Sit together.

## Set up a fork

1. Create a `GitHub` account.
2. Go to the [original repo](https://github.com/inno-se-toolkit/lab-01-market-product-and-git) (repository).
3. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository) the original repo.
4. Go to your fork.
5. The URL should be like `https://github.com/<your-username>/lab-01-market-product-and-git`.
6. If you see a lock sign near your fork name, [make your fork public](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/setting-repository-visibility#changing-a-repositorys-visibility).

> [!NOTE]
> Continue working in your fork.

## Enable issues

1. Go to `Settings` -> `General` -> `Features`.
2. Check the box near `Issues`.

## Add a classmate as a collaborator

1. Go to `Settings` -> `Collaborators` -> `Add people`.
2. Add your partner as a collaborator.
3. Your partner should add you as a collaborator in their repo.
4. Make sure your collaborator has accepted the invitation sent to their email.
5. It's OK if your collaborator can't change `Settings` in your repo.

## Protect your `main` branch

Branch protection prevents accidental pushes directly to `main`.
This enforces the PR workflow and ensures all changes are reviewed.

1. Go to your fork on `GitHub`.
2. Go to `Settings`.
3. Go to `Code and automation`.
4. Go to `Rules`.
5. Go to `Rulesets`.
6. Go to `New ruleset`.
7. Go to `Add branch ruleset`.
8. Set:

   1. `Ruleset Name`: `push`
   2. `Enforcement status`: `Active`
   3. `Target branches` -> `Add target` -> `Include default branch`
   4. Rules:
      - [x] `Restrict deletions`
      - [x] `Require a pull request before merging`:
         - `Required approvals`: `1`
         - `Require conversation resolution before merging`
         - `Allowed merge methods`: `Merge`.
      - [x] Block force pushes
