# Practice the `Git workflow`

**Time:** ~15 min

**Purpose:** Practice the [`Git workflow`](../git-workflow.md) before working on the main tasks.

**Context:** This task is an opportunity to practice the full cycle (Issue → Branch → Commits → PR → Review → Merge).

## Steps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Read [`Git workflow`](../git-workflow.md).

### 1. Create an issue

Title: `[Task] Add my name to contributors`

### 2. Create a branch

On the issue page, click `Create a branch` in the right sidebar.

Alternatively, use the terminal:

```bash
git checkout -b add-contributor
```

### 3. Add your name

> [!NOTE]
> Replace `@<your-username>` with your `GitHub` username.
> Example: `@johndoe`

1. Open [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](../../../CONTRIBUTORS.md).
2. Add your GitHub username below the comment:

    ```markdown
    <!--
    ...
    -->
    - @<your-username>
    ```

3. Save the file.

### 4. Commit and push

```bash
git add CONTRIBUTORS.md
git commit -m 'docs: add <your-username> to contributors'
git push -u origin add-contributor
```

### 5. Create a Pull Request (PR)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the title `Add @<your-username> to contributors` but replace `@<your-username>`.
> Example: `Add @johndoe to contributors`

[Create a PR](../git-workflow.md#create-a-pr) and continue following the `Git workflow` from there.
